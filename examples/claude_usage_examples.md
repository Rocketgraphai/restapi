## Advanced Analytics Examples

### Example 6: Network Analysis

**User**: "Analyze the transaction network to find potential money laundering patterns"

**Claude Response**: "I'll analyze the transaction network for suspicious patterns that might indicate money laundering."

```cypher
// Find circular transaction patterns
MATCH path = (a1:Account)-[:TRANSACTION*3..5]->(a1)
WHERE all(r in relationships(path) WHERE r.amount > 5000)
  AND all(r in relationships(path) WHERE r.transaction_date > datetime() - duration({days: 90}))
RETURN 
  [n in nodes(path) | n.account_id] as account_cycle,
  [r in relationships(path) | r.amount] as amounts,
  length(path) as cycle_length,
  reduce(total = 0, r in relationships(path) | total + r.amount) as total_amount
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Claude Output**: "üö® **Suspicious Activity Detected**

Found 7 potential circular transaction patterns:

**High Priority Alerts:**
1. **Circular Pattern A**: 4 accounts, $89,500 total
   - Accounts: ACC_1234 ‚Üí ACC_5678 ‚Üí ACC_9012 ‚Üí ACC_1234  
   - Pattern: $25K ‚Üí $30K ‚Üí $34.5K (3-hop cycle)

## Integration Examples

### Example 10: Automated Monitoring

**User**: "Set up monitoring for suspicious activity patterns"

**Claude Response**: "I'll help you set up queries that can be used for ongoing monitoring of suspicious patterns. Here are the key monitoring queries I recommend:

**Daily Monitoring Queries:**

1. **Large Transaction Alert** (Run daily):
```cypher
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:OWNS]->(a1:Account)-[t:TRANSACTION]->(a2:Account)
WHERE t.amount > 15000 
  AND t.transaction_date > datetime() - duration({days: 1})
RETURN c.name, t.amount, t.transaction_date, c.risk_score
ORDER BY t.amount DESC
```

2. **Velocity Check** (Unusual activity volume):
```cypher
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:OWNS]->(a:Account)-[t:TRANSACTION]->()
WHERE t.transaction_date > datetime() - duration({days: 1})
WITH c, count(t) as daily_txns, avg(t.amount) as avg_amount
WHERE daily_txns > 20 OR avg_amount > 5000
RETURN c.name, daily_txns, avg_amount, c.risk_score
ORDER BY daily_txns DESC
```

I can run these queries for you regularly, or you can integrate them into your monitoring systems. Would you like me to execute these checks now?"

These examples show how Claude can serve as an intelligent interface to your graph data, providing both ad-hoc analysis and structured reporting capabilities through the MCP integration.
